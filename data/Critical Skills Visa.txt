## Critical Skills Visa

#### Introduction

The Critical Skills Work Visa will enable the Department and the government to achieve the objectives of programmes such as National Development Plan(NDP), Industrial Policy Action Plan(IPAP) and New Growth Plan(NGP). The Department of Home Affairs has amended the Immigration legislation that came with various changes, which led to the introduction of Critical Skills Work Visa (CSWV).

The Critical Skills Work Visa emanates from the merger of the former Exceptional Skills and Quota Work visas. The latter was issued in line with the Quota List of 2009, which had skills categories, requirements, and the quota of skills targeted in the Republic of South Africa. The Critical Skills work visa is issued in accordance with the [_**critical skills list**_](/images/PDFs/CritcalSkills_102023.pdf). The list was developed in conjunction with the ocupations in high demand and the scarce skills lists of the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET). The main objective of the critical skills work visa is to assist the government to realise the achievement of the National Infrastructure Project, the Strategic Infrastructure Projects and Key National Strategic Projects in support of the Department of Trade and Industry.
