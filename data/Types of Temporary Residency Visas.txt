An application for the extension of the validity of a temporary residence visa must be done at least 60 days prior to the expiry of the visa by submitting an application online at [**_www.vfsglobal.com/dha/southafrica_**](http://www.vfsglobal.com/dha/southafrica).

Occasionally, multi-national companies may decide to transfer an existing employee in a key position from a foreign branch to a branch, subsidiary or an affiliate of that company in South Africa.
